# Tillson's Bookmarks
Resources for programming, security, computers, and really anything I'm into.  This is more of a personal bookmark list than a full-on resource list, but still may prove helpful in the respective topics.  
I'll add to this as I come across more resources.

## General Computer Things
* [CyberChef: The Cyber Swiss Army Knife](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) - Tons of crypto operations.  Also has utilities for *everything* computer related.
